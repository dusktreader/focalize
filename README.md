Focalize provides context within logs for blocks of code that are encircled by a
context manager. This helps contextualize log lines within deeply nested call chains or
within complex operations where many logical steps are taken.

## Super-quick Start

* Only requires Python 3.8 or later
* Installed with pip (`$ pip install focalize`)
* Demo available in [examples](https://github.com/dusktreader/focalize/tree/main/examples/demo.py)
